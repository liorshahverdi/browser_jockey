# Testing Guide - After Refactoring

## üß™ How to Test the Refactored Code

Before deploying, you should test all features to ensure the refactoring didn't break anything.

## üöÄ Quick Start Test

1. **Start the server:**
   ```bash
   python run.py
   ```

2. **Open in browser:**
   - Navigate to `http://localhost:5000` (or your configured port)
   - Open browser console (F12) to watch for errors

### Integration Tests

#### 10. Combined Features
- [ ] Use microphone + vocoder + autotune together
- [ ] Record while using microphone effects
- [ ] Use sampler while tracks are playing
- [ ] Mix all three: tracks + mic + sampler
- [ ] Verify no audio glitches or distortion

#### 11. Error Handling
- [ ] Try enabling vocoder without microphone (should show alert)
- [ ] Try enabling autotune without microphone (should show alert)
- [ ] Load invalid audio file (should handle gracefully)
- [ ] Rapidly enable/disable features (should not crash)

#### 12. Performance
- [ ] Check CPU usage in browser task manager
- [ ] Play audio for 5+ minutes (check for memory leaks)
- [ ] Enable multiple effects simultaneously
- [ ] Verify smooth waveform animation

## üêõ What to Look For

### In Browser Console (F12)
- ‚ùå No red error messages
- ‚úÖ Only informational logs (green/blue)
- ‚úÖ Module loading messages
- ‚úÖ Feature enable/disable messages

### Common Issues to Check
1. **Import Errors**: Module not found or import syntax errors
2. **Undefined References**: Variables/functions not accessible
3. **Audio Glitches**: Crackling, popping, or stuttering
4. **Memory Leaks**: Browser slowing down over time
5. **UI Responsiveness**: Buttons/sliders not responding

## üìä Expected Console Output

When features are enabled, you should see:
```
Microphone enabled successfully
Vocoder enabled with 16 bands
Auto-tune enabled
Recording started
```

## üîß Troubleshooting

### If Microphone Doesn't Work:
1. Check browser permissions (click lock icon in address bar)
2. Ensure microphone is not used by another app
3. Try refreshing the page
4. Check console for specific error messages

### If Vocoder/Autotune Doesn't Work:
1. Ensure microphone is enabled first
2. Check that a carrier source is selected for vocoder
3. Verify audio is playing from the carrier source
4. Check console for error messages

### If Modules Don't Load:
1. Verify the HTML file has `<script type="module">`
2. Check that all `.js` files exist in the modules folder
3. Clear browser cache (Ctrl+Shift+R / Cmd+Shift+R)
4. Check browser console for import errors

## ‚úÖ Success Criteria

All tests pass if:
- ‚úÖ No console errors
- ‚úÖ All features work as expected
- ‚úÖ Audio quality is good (no glitches)
- ‚úÖ UI is responsive
- ‚úÖ No memory leaks over time
- ‚úÖ All module imports work correctly

## üìù Reporting Issues

If you find any issues:
1. Note which feature is affected
2. Copy the console error message
3. Note the browser and version
4. Document steps to reproduce
5. Check if issue existed before refactoring

## üéâ When Testing is Complete

Once all features work correctly:
1. Commit the changes
2. Deploy to production
3. Monitor for any user-reported issues
4. Celebrate the successful refactoring! üéä

**Note:** The refactoring should NOT have changed any functionality. If something doesn't work, it's likely a minor issue that can be quickly fixed by checking the console error messages.
