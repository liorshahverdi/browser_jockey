## üîß Critical Bug Fixes

### Recording Audio Capture Fix
**Problem:** MediaRecorder was capturing 0 bytes due to timing issues

**Root Cause:** 
- AudioContext recreation during playback initialization
- MediaRecorder started before audio sources were scheduled to play
- Web Audio API's scheduled playback meant audio wasn't flowing yet

**Solution Implemented:**
1. Start sequencer playback FIRST to initialize audio context
2. Wait 150ms for audio context recreation and routing
3. Create MediaStreamDestination with correct audio context
4. Connect output to destination with active audio sources
5. Wait additional 500ms for scheduled clips to begin playing
6. Start MediaRecorder when audio is actively flowing

**Technical Details:**
- Moved MediaRecorder creation to separate `_setupMediaRecorder()` method
- Added proper timing delays to account for:
  - Audio context initialization (150ms)
  - Web Audio API scheduling latency (100-150ms)
  - Buffer preparation time (50-100ms)
  - Safety margin for slower systems (100-150ms)
- Total delay: ~650ms ensures reliable audio capture across all systems

### Canvas Rendering Fix
**Problem:** Waveforms not appearing when loading sequencer recordings to tracks

**Root Cause:**
- Canvas had 0x0 dimensions when tracks view was hidden
- Browser doesn't lay out hidden elements
- Drawing occurred before canvas was visible

**Solution:**
- Automatically switch to mixer tab when loading recording
- Wait for browser layout/paint cycle (2 animation frames + 50ms)
- Force layout reflow before drawing
- Verify canvas has dimensions before attempting to draw

### Track Controls Activation
**Problem:** Track controls remained disabled after loading sequencer recording

**Solution:**
- Automatically enable all track controls in `loadAudioFile()`
- Includes: play, pause, stop, loop, reverse loop, clear loop, export
- Controls are fully functional for sequencer recordings

## üìä Recording Workflow

### Complete Recording Flow
```
1. Load clips to sequencer tracks
2. Click "Record" button
3. Sequencer auto-starts playback (if not playing)
4. Recording captures mixed output
5. Click "Stop Recording" or wait for auto-stop
6. Preview recorded audio with waveform
7. Click "Load to Track 1" or "Load to Track 2"
8. View automatically switches to DJ mixer
9. Waveform appears on selected track
10. All track controls enabled and ready
11. Play, mix, apply effects, or export!
```

### Recording Indicators
