# Sequencer Feature

## Overview

The sequencer feature allows you to arrange and layer audio clips from your loaded tracks in a timeline-based interface. You can create multi-track compositions by dragging and dropping clips onto a grid-based sequencer.

## Features

### Tab Navigation
- **DJ Mixer Tab**: The original dual-track DJ interface
- **Sequencer Tab**: The new sequencer interface for arranging clips

### Sequencer Controls
- **Play/Pause/Stop**: Control playback of the sequencer arrangement
- **Add/Remove Bars**: Dynamically adjust the length of your composition (each bar represents a musical measure)
- **BPM Control**: Set the tempo (60-200 BPM) to match your composition

### Available Clips Panel
- Automatically populated when you load tracks in the DJ Mixer tab
- Each loaded track becomes an available clip
- Shows clip name and duration
- **Add New Track** button to create additional sequencer tracks

### Sequencer Timeline
- **Timeline Ruler**: Shows bar numbers for easy reference
- **Multiple Tracks**: Layer unlimited tracks on top of each other
- **Drag and Drop**: Drag clips from the available clips panel to any track
- **Snap to Grid**: Clips automatically snap to bar boundaries
- **Move Clips**: Click and drag clips within a track to reposition them
- **Delete Clips**: Double-click a clip to remove it from the timeline

### Track Controls
- **Mute**: Silence a specific track during playback
- **Solo**: Play only this track (mutes all other tracks)
- **Delete**: Remove a track from the sequencer

## Technical Details

### Grid System
- Each bar is 150 pixels wide
- Clips automatically snap to bar boundaries when placed
- Time signature: 4/4 (default)
- Bar duration calculated as: (60 / BPM) √ó 4 seconds

### Audio Playback
- Uses Web Audio API for precise timing
- All clips are scheduled at the correct time positions
- Playback syncs to the BPM setting
- Audio buffers are reused from loaded tracks for efficiency

### Drag and Drop
- Native HTML5 drag and drop API
- Visual feedback when dragging
- Drop indicators show valid drop zones
- Grid snapping for easy alignment

## Keyboard Shortcuts

Currently, there are no keyboard shortcuts specific to the sequencer. This is a potential future enhancement.

## Limitations

1. **Fixed Time Signature**: Currently supports 4/4 time only
2. **No Clip Editing**: Clips cannot be trimmed or edited within the sequencer
3. **No MIDI Support**: Audio clips only, no MIDI sequencing
4. **No Volume Automation**: Track volume/mute/solo are global, not automated over time
5. **No Export**: The sequencer arrangement cannot be exported directly (use master recording in DJ Mixer tab)

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements for future versions:
- [ ] Clip trimming and time-stretching
- [ ] Volume and pan automation lanes
- [ ] MIDI sequencing support
- [ ] Export sequencer arrangement to audio file
- [ ] Copy/paste clips
- [ ] Undo/redo functionality
- [ ] Keyboard shortcuts for common actions
- [ ] Zoom controls for timeline
- [ ] Multiple time signature support
- [ ] Click track / metronome
- [ ] Loop region playback
- [ ] Markers and regions

## Integration with DJ Mixer

The sequencer is fully integrated with the main DJ application:
- Clips use the same audio buffers as the DJ mixer tracks
- The same AudioContext is shared between both features
- Switch seamlessly between DJ Mixer and Sequencer tabs
- Load files in DJ Mixer, arrange them in Sequencer

## Browser Compatibility

The sequencer uses:
- Web Audio API (all modern browsers)
- HTML5 Drag and Drop (all modern browsers)
- ES6 Modules (all modern browsers)
- CSS Grid (all modern browsers)

Tested on:
- Chrome/Edge (Recommended)
- Firefox
- Safari

## Code Structure

### Files Modified
- `app/templates/index.html` - Added tab navigation and sequencer UI
- `app/static/css/style.css` - Added sequencer and tab navigation styles
- `app/static/js/visualizer-dual.js` - Integrated sequencer into main app
- `app/static/js/modules/sequencer.js` - New sequencer module

### Key Classes
- `Sequencer` - Main sequencer class managing state and interactions
  - `clips` - Map of available audio clips
  - `sequencerTracks` - Array of sequencer tracks with placed clips
  - `currentBPM` - Tempo setting
  - `numberOfBars` - Length of composition

### Key Methods
- `addClip()` - Add a new clip to the available clips library
- `addSequencerTrack()` - Create a new track in the timeline
- `addClipToTrack()` - Place a clip instance on a track
- `play()` - Start sequencer playback
- `stop()` - Stop playback and reset

## Tips

1. **Start Simple**: Begin with 4-8 bars and add more as needed
2. **Use Multiple Tracks**: Create separate tracks for different elements (drums, melody, etc.)
3. **Experiment**: Try different clip positions and combinations
4. **Mute/Solo**: Use these to focus on specific parts of your arrangement
5. **BPM Matching**: Set the sequencer BPM to match your loaded tracks for best results

## Troubleshooting

**Clips not appearing?**
- Make sure you've loaded tracks in the DJ Mixer tab first
- Check that the audio files loaded successfully

**Can't drag clips?**
- Ensure you're clicking and holding on the clip item
- Try refreshing the page if drag and drop stops working

**Playback not working?**
- Check browser console for errors
- Ensure audio context is initialized (load a track first)
- Try clicking play again

**Clips not aligned properly?**
- Clips snap to bar boundaries automatically
- Adjust BPM if timing seems off
