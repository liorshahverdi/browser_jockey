# Tab Audio Capture Feature

**Date:** October 26, 2025  
**Feature:** Real-time audio capture from browser tabs to DJ tracks

## Overview

This feature allows users to capture audio playing in another browser tab and route it to Track 1 or Track 2 in real-time. This enables DJs to:

- Mix audio from streaming services (YouTube, Spotify, SoundCloud, etc.)
- Apply effects to live broadcasts or podcasts
- Layer effects on web-based synthesizers or music apps
- Create mashups with online audio sources

## How It Works

### User Flow

1. **Click "üéµ Capture Tab Audio" button** on Track 1 or Track 2
2. **Browser shows tab picker dialog**
   - Select the tab playing audio
   - **Important:** Check the "Share audio" checkbox
   - Click "Share"
3. **Audio streams to the track** in real-time
4. **Apply effects** using the track's controls (volume, pan, filter, reverb, delay, etc.)
5. **Mix with other tracks** using the crossfader
6. **Click Stop** to end the capture

### Technical Implementation

#### Browser API Used
- **`navigator.mediaDevices.getDisplayMedia()`** with audio constraints
- Supported in Chrome, Edge, and other Chromium-based browsers
- Requires user permission and active user gesture

#### Audio Routing

```
Browser Tab Audio
    ‚Üì
MediaStream (captured)
    ‚Üì
MediaStreamSource (Web Audio API)
    ‚Üì
Track Effects Chain (Gain ‚Üí Pan ‚Üí Filter ‚Üí Reverb ‚Üí Delay)
    ‚Üì
Merger ‚Üí Master Effects ‚Üí Output
```

#### Key Differences from File Loading

| Feature | File Loading | Tab Capture |
|---------|-------------|-------------|
| Source | Audio file from disk | Live audio stream |
| Playback Control | Play/Pause/Stop | Stop only (live stream) |
| Looping | ‚úÖ Supported | ‚ùå Not available |
| Waveform Display | ‚úÖ Shows full waveform | ‚ùå Live stream only |
| Export | ‚úÖ Can export | ‚ùå Cannot export directly |
| Effects | ‚úÖ All effects work | ‚úÖ All effects work |
| BPM/Key Detection | ‚úÖ Automatic | ‚ùå Not available |

## Code Changes

### HTML Changes (`app/templates/index.html`)

Added capture buttons for both tracks:

```html
<!-- Track 1 -->
<button id="captureTabAudio1" class="upload-btn" title="Capture audio from another browser tab">
    <span>üéµ Capture Tab Audio</span>
</button>

<!-- Track 2 -->
<button id="captureTabAudio2" class="upload-btn" title="Capture audio from another browser tab">
    <span>üéµ Capture Tab Audio</span>
</button>
```

### JavaScript Changes (`app/static/js/visualizer-dual.js`)

#### New DOM References

```javascript
const captureTabAudio1 = document.getElementById('captureTabAudio1');
const captureTabAudio2 = document.getElementById('captureTabAudio2');
```

#### New State Variables

```javascript
let tabCaptureStream1 = null;
let tabCaptureStream2 = null;
let tabCaptureSource1 = null;
let tabCaptureSource2 = null;
```

#### New Function: `captureTabAudio(trackNumber)`

**Purpose:** Captures audio from a browser tab and routes it to a track

**Parameters:**
- `trackNumber` (1 or 2) - Which track to route the audio to

**Process:**
1. Check browser support for `getDisplayMedia`
2. Request display media with audio constraints
3. Validate that audio track exists
4. Initialize audio context if needed
5. Create `MediaStreamSource` from the captured stream
6. Connect to track's effect chain
7. Update UI (disable play/loop controls, enable stop)
8. Set up stream end handler
9. Start visualization

**Error Handling:**
- `NotAllowedError` - Permission denied by user
- `NotFoundError` - No audio source in selected tab
- `AbortError` - User cancelled selection
- Generic errors with descriptive messages

#### Event Listeners

```javascript
if (captureTabAudio1) {
    captureTabAudio1.addEventListener('click', () => captureTabAudio(1));
}

if (captureTabAudio2) {
    captureTabAudio2.addEventListener('click', () => captureTabAudio(2));
}
```

#### Stop Button Enhancement

Updated stop button handlers to clean up tab capture:

```javascript
stopBtn1.addEventListener('click', () => {
    // ... existing code ...
    
    // Stop tab capture if active
    if (tabCaptureStream1) {
        tabCaptureStream1.getTracks().forEach(track => track.stop());
        tabCaptureStream1 = null;
    }
    if (tabCaptureSource1) {
        try {
            tabCaptureSource1.disconnect();
        } catch (e) {
            console.log('Error disconnecting tab capture source:', e);
        }
        tabCaptureSource1 = null;
        source1 = null;
    }
    if (fileName1.textContent.includes('Tab Audio')) {
        fileName1.textContent = 'No file selected';
        stopBtn1.disabled = true;
    }
});
```

## Usage Examples

### Example 1: DJ Mix with YouTube
1. Open YouTube in another tab, start playing a song
2. In Browser Jockey, click "üéµ Capture Tab Audio" on Track 1
3. Select the YouTube tab, ensure "Share audio" is checked
4. The YouTube audio now streams to Track 1
5. Load a local file on Track 2
6. Use crossfader to mix between YouTube and local file

### Example 2: Live Effects on Podcast
1. Open a podcast streaming site in another tab
2. Capture the audio to Track 1
3. Apply reverb, delay, and filter effects in real-time
4. Record your mic commentary on Track 2
5. Mix and fade between podcast and your voice

### Example 3: Web Synth Layering
1. Open a web-based synthesizer (like WebSynths.com)
2. Capture the synth output to Track 1
3. Load a drum loop on Track 2
4. Apply different effects to each track
5. Use crossfader for transitions

## Browser Compatibility

### Supported Browsers
- ‚úÖ Google Chrome (desktop)
- ‚úÖ Microsoft Edge (desktop)
- ‚úÖ Opera (desktop)
- ‚úÖ Brave (desktop)
- ‚úÖ Other Chromium-based browsers

### Not Supported
- ‚ùå Firefox (limited getDisplayMedia audio support)
- ‚ùå Safari (no tab audio capture)
- ‚ùå Mobile browsers (no screen/tab sharing)

### Feature Detection

The app checks for browser support before attempting capture:

```javascript
if (!navigator.mediaDevices || !navigator.mediaDevices.getDisplayMedia) {
    alert('‚ùå Tab audio capture is not supported in your browser.');
    return;
}
```

## Limitations

### Technical Limitations

1. **No Waveform Display** - Live streams don't have a known duration/waveform
2. **No Looping** - Can't set A-B loop points on live audio
3. **No Direct Export** - Can't export the captured stream directly (but you can record the master output)
4. **No BPM Detection** - Requires full audio buffer
5. **No Play/Pause** - Live stream is always "playing" until stopped

### User Experience Considerations

1. **Must check "Share audio"** - Easy to forget in the picker dialog
2. **Tab must have audio** - Silent tabs won't provide audio tracks
3. **Stream ends when tab closes** - Closing the source tab stops the capture
4. **Latency** - Some audio latency is unavoidable (typically 50-200ms)

## Troubleshooting

### "No audio was captured from the selected tab"

**Causes:**
- Forgot to check "Share audio" checkbox
- Selected a window/screen instead of a tab
- Tab is not playing any audio

**Solution:**
1. Click "üéµ Capture Tab Audio" again
2. Select a **tab** (not window/screen)
3. Check the **"Share audio"** checkbox
4. Make sure the tab is actively playing audio

### "Tab audio capture is not supported"

**Cause:** Using unsupported browser

**Solution:** Use Chrome, Edge, or another Chromium-based browser

### "Audio is delayed/laggy"

**Cause:** Normal browser audio processing latency

**Solution:** 
- Some latency is unavoidable with tab capture
- Try using a wired connection if on WiFi
- Close other heavy browser tabs

### "Capture stopped suddenly"

**Causes:**
- Source tab was closed
- Source tab navigated to a different page
- User stopped sharing from the source tab

**Solution:** Restart the capture with the correct tab

### "Effects don't seem to work"

**Cause:** Source audio might be very quiet or very loud

**Solution:**
- Adjust the source tab's volume
- Use the track volume slider
- Check filter cutoff isn't too low

## Future Enhancements

### Potential Improvements

- [ ] **Recording support** - Record the captured tab audio
- [ ] **Visual feedback** - Show audio level meter for captured stream
- [ ] **Auto-reconnect** - Option to automatically reconnect if stream drops
- [ ] **Multiple tab mixing** - Capture from multiple tabs simultaneously
- [ ] **Screen audio option** - Capture all system audio (where supported)
- [ ] **Latency adjustment** - Manual latency compensation control
- [ ] **Stream preview** - Preview audio before routing to track

### Advanced Features

- [ ] **Real-time BPM detection** - Analyze live stream for tempo
- [ ] **Buffer and loop** - Option to buffer captured audio for looping
- [ ] **Stem recording** - Record the processed track output
- [ ] **Auto-ducking** - Automatically lower tab audio when mic is active

## Security & Privacy

### Permissions Required
- Screen/tab sharing permission (user must grant via browser dialog)
- Audio capture from the selected tab only

### Privacy Notes
- Only captures audio from the **selected tab**
- Does not record screen content (video track is discarded)
- User must explicitly grant permission each time
- User can see which tab is being shared (browser indicator)
- Capture can be stopped at any time by clicking Stop or closing the source tab

### Best Practices
- Always inform users if you're capturing their audio
- Respect copyright when using audio from streaming services
- Use for personal/educational purposes or ensure proper licensing
