# Release Notes - Version 3.16

## Sequencer Clip Effects

**Release Date**: October 26, 2025

### üéõÔ∏è New Feature: Individual Clip Effects

We've added a powerful new effects system that allows you to apply audio processing to individual clips in the sequencer, completely independent from the DJ Mixer track effects.

### What's New

#### Click-to-Edit Effects Panel
- **Click any clip** on the sequencer timeline to open a dedicated effects panel
- Effects panel slides in elegantly from the right side
- Selected clips are highlighted with a golden border for visual feedback
- Effects settings are saved per-clip and applied during playback

#### 6 Professional Audio Effects Per Clip

1. **Volume Control (0-150%)**
   - Boost or reduce individual clip loudness
   - Perfect for balancing different audio sources

2. **Pitch Shift (-12 to +12 semitones)**
   - Change pitch up or down by one octave
   - Create harmonies by duplicating and pitch-shifting clips
   - Useful for key matching different samples

3. **Multimode Filter (20Hz - 20kHz)**
   - Low Pass, High Pass, and Band Pass filter types
   - Shape the frequency content of your clips
   - Create sweeping filter effects

4. **Reverb (0-100%)**
   - Add spatial depth and ambience
   - Wet/dry mix for subtle to extreme effects
   - Great for creating atmosphere

5. **Delay Effect (0-100%)**
   - Echo effect with feedback
   - Adjustable mix level
   - Perfect for rhythmic effects

6. **Delay Time (50-2000ms)**
   - Control the timing between delay repeats
   - From slapback to long echoes
   - Sync with your BPM for musical delays

#### Smart UI Integration
- Workspace automatically expands to 3-column layout when effects panel opens
- "Reset All Effects" button to quickly return to defaults
- Real-time value displays for all parameters
- Effects persist across play/stop cycles

### Technical Improvements

- **Per-Clip Effects Chain**: Each clip gets its own Web Audio API effects chain during playback
- **Optimized Routing**: Effects are applied efficiently without affecting other clips
- **Memory Efficient**: Effects settings stored in lightweight Map structure
- **Zero Latency**: Effects applied at schedule time for perfect synchronization

### How It Works

```
Signal Flow per Clip:
Audio Buffer ‚Üí Filter ‚Üí Volume ‚Üí Delay (wet/dry) ‚Üí Sequencer Output ‚Üí Master
```

### Use Cases

- **Layered Percussion**: Apply different reverb amounts to create depth in drum patterns
- **Melodic Harmonies**: Duplicate clips and pitch shift for instant harmonies
- **Filter Automation**: Create builds and breakdowns with filter sweeps
- **Rhythmic Effects**: Use delay on specific clips for call-and-response patterns
- **Dynamic Mixing**: Balance clip volumes independently

### Compatibility

- ‚úÖ Works with all sequencer clips (full tracks and loop regions)
- ‚úÖ Compatible with master routing and effects chain
- ‚úÖ Independent from DJ Mixer track effects
- ‚úÖ Sampler and Theremin can still use sequencer as source

### Breaking Changes

None - this is a purely additive feature.

### Known Limitations

- Effects are applied at playback schedule time (not real-time during playback)
- To hear effect changes, stop and restart sequencer playback
- Reverb uses simplified implementation (future versions may add convolver)

### Files Modified

- `app/templates/index.html` - Added effects panel UI
- `app/static/css/style.css` - Added effects panel styling (~120 lines)
- `app/static/js/modules/sequencer.js` - Added effects system (~180 lines)

### Next Steps

Try it out:
1. Load some tracks in the DJ Mixer
2. Switch to the Sequencer tab
3. Drag clips onto the timeline
4. Click a clip to open the effects panel
5. Experiment with the effects!

### Future Enhancements

Planned improvements:
- Visual effect curve automation over time
- Effect presets and templates
- Copy/paste effects between clips
- Advanced reverb with impulse responses
- Real-time effect modulation during playback
