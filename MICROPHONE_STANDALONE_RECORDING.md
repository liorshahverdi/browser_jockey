# Microphone Standalone Recording Feature

## Overview
Extended the microphone capabilities to allow standalone recording directly from the microphone without requiring any audio tracks to be loaded.

## Changes Made

### 1. Microphone Module (`app/static/js/modules/microphone.js`)
- **Added** `startMicRecording(micState)` - Starts recording from the microphone stream
- **Added** `stopMicRecording(recordingState)` - Stops recording and returns the audio blob

### 2. Recording Module (`app/static/js/modules/recording.js`)
- **Exported** `audioBufferToMp3()` function to allow MP3 conversion from other modules

### 3. HTML Template (`app/templates/index.html`)
- **Added** Microphone Recording Section with:
  - Record/Stop buttons
  - Real-time recording timer
  - Waveform visualization canvas
  - Playback controls (audio player)
  - Export buttons (WAV and MP3)

### 4. CSS Styles (`app/static/css/style.css`)
- **Added** `.mic-recording-section` styling
- **Added** `.mic-recording-header` styling
- **Added** `.mic-recording-controls` styling
- **Added** `.recording-time` with pulse animation
- **Added** `.mic-recording-waveform-container` styling
- **Added** `.mic-recording-playback` styling
- **Added** `.export-btn` styling with hover effects

### 5. Main Visualizer (`app/static/js/visualizer-dual.js`)
- **Imported** `startMicRecording` and `stopMicRecording` from microphone module
- **Added** DOM element references for microphone recording UI
- **Added** State variables:
  - `micRecordingState` - Recording state object
  - `micRecordingAnimationId` - Animation frame ID for waveform
  - `micRecordingInterval` - Timer interval for recording duration
- **Added** Event listeners:
  - `micRecordBtn` - Start recording
  - `micStopBtn` - Stop recording
  - `micExportWavBtn` - Export as WAV
  - `micExportMp3Btn` - Export as MP3
- **Added** Functions:
  - `startMicRecordingHandler()` - Handles starting microphone recording
  - `stopMicRecordingHandler()` - Handles stopping and processing recording
  - `drawMicRecordingWaveform()` - Real-time waveform visualization during recording
  - `exportMicRecording(format)` - Export recording in WAV or MP3 format
- **Modified** `enableMicrophone()` - Shows recording section when mic is enabled
- **Modified** `disableMicrophone()` - Stops recording and hides section when mic is disabled

## Features

### Recording
- ✅ Start/Stop recording from microphone
- ✅ Real-time recording timer with pulse animation
- ✅ Real-time waveform visualization during recording
- ✅ Automatic cleanup when microphone is disabled

### Playback
- ✅ Audio player with native browser controls
- ✅ Final waveform visualization of recorded audio
- ✅ Visual feedback with color-coded waveform (#ff0064 pink)

### Export
- ✅ Export as WebM (native recording format)
- ✅ Export as WAV (uncompressed audio)
- ✅ Export as MP3 (compressed audio using lamejs)
- ✅ Automatic filename generation with timestamp

## User Workflow

1. **Enable Microphone**: Click "Enable Microphone" button
2. **Recording Section Appears**: Shows "Microphone Recording" section
3. **Start Recording**: Click "Record Mic" button
   - Recording timer starts (with pulse animation)
   - Real-time waveform displays audio input
4. **Stop Recording**: Click "Stop Recording" button
   - Recording stops
   - Final waveform is rendered
   - Audio player appears with playback controls
5. **Export**: Click "Export as WAV" or "Export as MP3"
   - File downloads automatically with timestamp

## Technical Details

### Recording Implementation
- Uses MediaRecorder API to capture microphone stream
- Stores audio in WebM format during recording
- Decodes to AudioBuffer for format conversion

### Waveform Visualization
- Real-time: Uses AnalyserNode with getByteTimeDomainData()
- Final: Uses decoded AudioBuffer for accurate visualization
- Color-coded: Pink (#ff0064) for microphone recordings

### Format Conversion
- **WAV**: Uses custom PCM encoding (16-bit, interleaved)
- **MP3**: Uses lamejs library (128 kbps encoding)
- **WebM**: Native format, no conversion needed

## Browser Compatibility
- Requires getUserMedia API support (modern browsers)
- Requires MediaRecorder API support
- MP3 export requires lamejs library to be loaded

## Future Enhancements
- [ ] Add recording quality settings
- [ ] Add recording length limit indicator
- [ ] Add ability to load microphone recording into track deck
- [ ] Add effects to microphone recording before export
- [ ] Add multi-segment recording with pause/resume
