# Release Notes - v3.20.0

## 🎉 Major Sequencer Enhancements

This release focuses on dramatically improving the sequencer workflow with clip trimming, real-time effects, smart UI optimizations, and automatic zoom adjustments.

---

## ✨ New Features

### 1. **Clip Trimming** ✂️
Trim sequencer clips non-destructively by dragging their edges!

**Features:**
- **Left Edge Trimming**: Drag right to trim from start, drag left to restore
- **Right Edge Trimming**: Drag left to trim from end, drag right to restore
- **Visual Handles**: 8px resize handles on clip edges with ↔ cursor
- **Real-time Waveform**: Waveform updates instantly to show trimmed portion
- **Playback Integration**: Only trimmed portion plays during sequencer playback
- **Smart Constraints**: Minimum 20px width, maximum trim leaves 0.1s minimum

**How to Use:**
1. Hover over left or right edge of a clip in the timeline
2. Cursor changes to resize arrows (↔)
3. Click and drag to trim
4. Waveform updates in real-time
5. Play to hear only the trimmed portion

**Technical Highlights:**
- Non-destructive: Original audio untouched
- Trim calculation from initial state (prevents accumulation bug)
- Supports both normal clips and loop region clips
- ADSR envelope applied to trimmed portion

📄 **Documentation**: `SEQUENCER_CLIP_TRIMMING.md`

### 2. **Real-Time Effect Updates** 🎛️
Adjust clip effects while sequencer is playing!

**Supported Real-Time Effects:**
- ✅ **Volume**: Dynamic gain with ADSR envelope preservation
- ✅ **Pitch**: Smooth semitone shifts via playback rate
- ✅ **Filter Frequency**: Sweepable filter cutoff
- ✅ **Filter Type**: Switch filter types (lowpass/highpass/bandpass/notch)
- ✅ **Delay Mix**: Adjust wet/dry balance
- ✅ **Delay Time**: Change delay duration
- ⚠️ **ADSR/Reverb**: Applied on next playback (too complex for live update)

**How to Use:**
1. Add a clip to a sequencer track
2. Select the clip (opens effects panel)
3. Press Play on the sequencer
4. Adjust effect sliders → hear changes immediately!

**Technical Highlights:**
- <10ms latency (one audio processing block)
- Web Audio API `setValueAtTime()` for glitch-free updates
- ADSR-aware volume adjustments
- Multi-instance support (updates all instances of a clip)
- Graceful degradation for complex effects

📄 **Documentation**: `SEQUENCER_REALTIME_EFFECT_UPDATES.md`

---

### 3. **Effects Panel Toggle** 👁️
Show/hide the effects panel to maximize workspace!

**Features:**
- **Toggle Button**: "🎛️ Effects Panel" in sequencer controls
- **Active State**: Button highlights when panel is visible
- **Smart Visibility**: Panel only shows when both toggled on AND clip selected
- **Space Reclamation**: Timeline expands when panel hidden

**Benefits:**
- More room for timeline and tracks
- Separate arrangement from mixing workflow
- Better for small screens

📄 **Documentation**: `SEQUENCER_EFFECTS_PANEL_TOGGLE.md`

---

### 4. **Timeline Auto-Resize** 📏
Timeline container grows/shrinks automatically based on track count!

**Features:**
- **Dynamic Height**: `min-height: 300px`, `max-height: 80vh`
- **Viewport Responsive**: Uses `vh` units for different screen sizes
- **No Wasted Space**: Container size matches content
- **Fullscreen Optimized**: `max-height: calc(100vh - 200px)` in fullscreen

**Benefits:**
- See more tracks without scrolling
- Better arrangement overview
- Works on all screen sizes (laptop to 4K)

📄 **Documentation**: `SEQUENCER_TIMELINE_AUTO_RESIZE.md`

---

### 5. **Timeline Expansion When Effects Hidden** 🔲
Timeline expands both horizontally AND vertically when effects panel is hidden!

**Space Gained:**
- **Horizontal**: +280px (space from hidden effects panel)
- **Vertical**: +5vh (85vh vs 80vh max-height)
- **Total on 1080p**: ~15,120px² more visible area (+27.6%)

**Features:**
- Smooth 0.3s CSS transitions
- Clips panel matches timeline height
- Grid layout adjusts automatically
- No JavaScript overhead

**Use Cases:**
- **Arrangement**: Hide effects, see 10+ tracks, maximize timeline
- **Mixing**: Show effects, balanced layout, 8-9 tracks visible

📄 **Documentation**: `SEQUENCER_TIMELINE_EXPANSION.md`

---

### 6. **Auto-Zoom to Fit** 🔍
Automatically zoom out when adding long clips to ensure full visibility!

**Features:**
- **Smart Zoom**: Only zooms out, never in (prevents disorientation)
- **10% Padding**: Adds breathing room on the right
- **Minimum Zoom**: 10% floor prevents over-shrinking
- **UI Sync**: Updates zoom slider and percentage display

**How It Works:**
1. Add a long clip (e.g., 3:45 duration)
2. Sequencer calculates required zoom to fit
3. Timeline zooms out automatically
4. Entire clip visible without scrolling

**Technical Highlights:**
- Context-aware (uses actual container width)
- Respects effects panel toggle (recalculates)
- Performance: Only on clip addition, not every operation

📄 **Documentation**: `SEQUENCER_AUTO_ZOOM_FIT.md`

---

### 7. **"Add Track" Button Always Visible** ➕
Fixed critical UX bug where "Add Track" button was missing when no clips loaded!

**Problem Solved:**
- Previously: Button only appeared after loading clips
- Now: Button ALWAYS visible, even with empty sequencer

**Visual Design:**
- **Green Gradient**: Distinct from purple clip items
- **Clear CTA**: "➕ Add New Track" stands out
- **Always at Bottom**: Consistent position in clips panel

**Benefits:**
- Immediate accessibility
- Clear workflow (add tracks before or after loading audio)
- No confusion about how to start

📄 **Documentation**: `SEQUENCER_ADD_TRACK_BUTTON_FIX.md`

## 🐛 Bug Fixes

### Trim Accumulation Fix
- **Issue**: Trim values accumulated to extreme amounts (225s instead of small adjustments)
- **Cause**: Incremental calculation on each mousemove event
- **Fix**: Store initial trim on mousedown, calculate from total delta
- **Impact**: Trim now works correctly and predictably

### Layout Consistency
- **Fixed**: Timeline and clips panel now grow/shrink together
- **Fixed**: Fullscreen mode uses more vertical space (50px additional)
- **Fixed**: Workspace grid transitions smoothly

---

## 🎨 UI/UX Improvements

### Visual Feedback
- **Resize Cursors**: Edges show ↔ cursor when hovering
- **Active Button States**: Toggle buttons highlight when active
- **Smooth Transitions**: 0.3s ease transitions for all layout changes
- **Console Logging**: Detailed feedback for effect updates and trim operations

### Accessibility
- **Minimum Sizes**: 300px min-height ensures usability
- **Responsive**: Works on screens from laptops to 4K
- **Keyboard Support**: Existing shortcuts remain functional

---

## 📊 Performance

- **Pure CSS Transitions**: No JavaScript overhead for layout changes
- **GPU Accelerated**: Smooth 60fps transitions
- **Web Audio API**: Real-time effects run in separate thread
- **Minimal Memory**: ~100 bytes per playing clip for effect nodes
