# Release Notes - Version 3.18

## Sequencer Recording Waveform & Loop Marker Fixes

**Release Date**: October 26, 2025

### 🐛 Bug Fixes

#### Fixed: Waveform Generation for Sequencer Recordings

**Problem Prevented:**
The sequencer recording feature initially displayed a placeholder waveform instead of showing the actual recorded audio data. This could have led to the same "no waveform generated" issues encountered earlier in development.

**Solution:**
- ✅ Properly decode recorded Blob to AudioBuffer
- ✅ Draw real audio amplitude data on canvas
- ✅ Use same waveform rendering as DJ Mixer tracks
- ✅ Graceful fallback if decoding fails

**Result:**
Sequencer recordings now display beautiful, accurate waveforms showing the actual audio content, making it easy to visualize what you've recorded.

### ✨ New Feature: A-B Loop Markers for Recordings

Just like the DJ Mixer tracks, sequencer recordings now support A-B loop markers!

**What's New:**

**Visual Loop Markers**
- Click waveform twice to set A and B points
- Green "A" marker shows loop start
- Red "B" marker shows loop end
- Highlighted region between markers

**Loop Controls**
- **Loop Button** (`🔁`): Toggle A-B repeat on/off
- **Clear Loop Button** (`❌ Clear Loop`): Remove all markers
- Button highlights when loop is active

**Smart Looping**
- Audio automatically jumps from B back to A
- Works with HTML5 audio controls
- Smooth, seamless looping
- Same behavior as DJ Mixer tracks

### How to Use

#### Setting Loop Points on Recordings

1. **Record Your Sequence**
   ```
   Arrange clips → Hit Record → Stop when done
   ```

2. **Set Loop Points**
   ```
   Click waveform for point A → Click again for point B
   ```

3. **Enable Loop**
   ```
   Click 🔁 button → Play audio → Loops between A-B
   ```

4. **Clear Loop** (optional)
   ```
   Click ❌ Clear Loop → Markers removed
   ```

#### Complete Workflow

```
Sequencer Arrangement
  ↓
Record Output
  ↓
Waveform Generated ← Real audio data! ✨
  ↓
Set A-B Loop Markers
  ↓
Enable Loop & Playback
  ↓
Download OR Load to Track 1/2
```

### Technical Improvements

**Waveform Generation:**
```javascript
// Decode blob to audio buffer
const arrayBuffer = await this.recordedBlob.arrayBuffer();
const audioBuffer = await audioContext.decodeAudioData(arrayBuffer);

// Draw actual amplitude data
const data = audioBuffer.getChannelData(0);
// ... render to canvas
```

**Loop Implementation:**
```javascript
// Monitor playback time
audioElement.addEventListener('timeupdate', () => {
    if (currentTime >= loopEnd) {
        currentTime = loopStart; // Jump back to start
    }
});
```

### Consistency with DJ Mixer

All features now match between DJ Mixer and Sequencer:

| Feature | DJ Mixer | Sequencer Recording | Status |
|---------|----------|---------------------|--------|
| Real waveform | ✅ | ✅ | Matching |
| A-B loop markers | ✅ | ✅ | Matching |
| Click to set markers | ✅ | ✅ | Matching |
| Loop toggle | ✅ | ✅ | Matching |
| Clear markers | ✅ | ✅ | Matching |
| Visual loop region | ✅ | ✅ | Matching |

### UI Enhancements

**Before:**
```
[Placeholder waveform]
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
   (static line)
```

**After:**
```
[Real waveform]
    ╱╲    ╱╲╱╲
   ╱  ╲  ╱    ╲╱╲
  ╱    ╲╱         ╲
A━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━B
  (loop region)
```

### Files Modified

**HTML Changes:**
- Added loop marker divs to sequencer recording section
- Added loop control buttons
- Wrapped waveform in proper container

**JavaScript Updates:**
- `sequencer.js`: +150 lines
  - Audio buffer decoding
  - Real waveform rendering
  - Loop marker click detection
  - A-B loop logic
  - Marker position updates

**CSS Additions:**
- Recording controls styling
- Reuses existing loop marker classes

### Memory Management

**Proper Cleanup:**
- AudioContext closed after decoding ✅
- Blob URLs revoked after use ✅
- Event listeners properly scoped ✅
- No memory leaks ✅

### Performance

**Optimized:**
- Waveform drawn once after recording
- Loop checking minimal overhead (timeupdate event)
- No continuous redrawing
- Efficient marker positioning (CSS percentages)

### Known Improvements Over Previous Bugs

This release specifically addresses:
1. ✅ Waveform not appearing (now properly generated)
2. ✅ Waveform showing placeholder only (now real data)
3. ✅ Inconsistent loop behavior (now reliable A-B looping)
4. ✅ Missing visual feedback (now clear markers and region)

### Breaking Changes

None - purely additive and bug fixes.

### Compatibility

- ✅ All existing sequencer features work unchanged
- ✅ Recording still produces same audio output
- ✅ Load to track functionality unaffected
- ✅ All effects still apply correctly

### Future Roadmap

**Planned Enhancements:**
- Zoom controls for recording waveform
- Drag markers to adjust loop points
- Visual playhead on recording
- Export loop region only (A-B extraction)
- Multiple loop segments

### Use Cases

**1. Perfect Your Loop**
```
Record sequence → Set precise loop points → Fine-tune → Export
```

**2. Sample Creation**
```
Record arrangement → Loop best section → Export as sample
```

**3. Performance Prep**
```
Record variations → Set loop markers → Load to tracks → Mix live
```

**4. Quality Check**
```
Record → View waveform → Check levels → Re-record if needed
```

### Testing Performed

- [x] Waveform displays real audio data
- [x] Click sets markers at correct positions
- [x] Loop region highlights properly
- [x] Audio loops seamlessly at markers
- [x] Clear button removes all markers
- [x] Load to track preserves audio quality
- [x] No console errors or warnings
- [x] Works in Chrome, Firefox, Safari

### Migration Notes

**For Users:**
- No changes needed to existing workflows
- New features available immediately
- Old recordings can still be loaded to tracks

**For Developers:**
- Same AudioBuffer decoding pattern as DJ Mixer
- Reuses existing loop marker CSS
- Follows established event handling patterns

**Version**: 3.18  
**Previous Version**: 3.17 (ADSR & Recording)  
**Type**: Bug Fix + Feature Enhancement

### Summary

This release ensures that sequencer recordings have the same professional quality and features as DJ Mixer tracks. The waveform now accurately represents your audio, and A-B loop markers give you precise control over playback. These improvements prevent potential bugs and create a consistent, intuitive user experience across the entire application.
