# Sequencer Auto-Zoom to Fit Feature

## Overview
Implemented automatic zoom adjustment that intelligently scales the sequencer timeline when long clips are added, ensuring the entire clip is visible without horizontal scrolling.

## Implementation Details

### Auto-Zoom Method
Added `autoZoomToFitLongestTrack()` method to the Sequencer class that:

1. **Calculates Maximum Content Width**: Iterates through all tracks and clips to find the rightmost edge
2. **Gets Container Dimensions**: Reads the actual visible width of the timeline container
3. **Calculates Required Zoom**: Determines the zoom level needed to fit all content with 10% padding
4. **Applies Zoom Intelligently**: Only zooms out (never in), with a 10% minimum zoom limit
5. **Updates UI**: Syncs the zoom slider and percentage display with the new zoom level
6. **Refreshes Display**: Calls `updateTimelineRuler()` and `updateAllTracksForZoom()` to redraw

### Integration Point
The method is called automatically in `addClipToTrack()` after:
- The clip is added to the track
- Timeline is expanded to fit clips via `expandTimelineToFitClips()`

### Zoom Calculation Formula
```javascript
const requiredZoomLevel = (targetWidth / maxRight) * this.zoomLevel;
```

Where:
- `targetWidth` = container width - 10% padding
- `maxRight` = rightmost edge of all clips at current zoom
- `this.zoomLevel` = current zoom multiplier

### Smart Zoom Behavior
- **Only Zoom Out**: Will never auto-zoom in to prevent disorienting the user
- **Minimum Zoom**: 10% (0.1) to prevent clips from becoming too small to see
- **Padding Buffer**: 10% of container width provides breathing room on the right
- **Preserves User Control**: User can manually adjust zoom after auto-zoom occurs

## User Experience

### Before Auto-Zoom
- Adding a long clip (e.g., 3:45 duration) would extend beyond visible area
- User had to manually zoom out using the slider
- Required trial and error to find the right zoom level

### After Auto-Zoom
- Long clips trigger automatic zoom adjustment
- Entire clip becomes immediately visible
- Optimal zoom level calculated automatically
- Smooth transition with updated UI controls

## Technical Benefits

1. **Context-Aware**: Uses actual container width, adapts to effects panel toggle
2. **Performance**: Only recalculates when clips are added, not on every operation
3. **UI Consistency**: Updates both the zoom slider and percentage display
4. **Non-Destructive**: Doesn't affect existing clips, just changes view scale
5. **Responsive**: Works with dynamic container sizing from effects panel toggle

## Edge Cases Handled

- Empty tracks (no clips) → No zoom change
- Multiple tracks with different lengths → Uses longest track
- Container width changes (effects panel toggle) → Recalculates on next clip add
- Very long clips → Respects 10% minimum zoom
- User manual zoom → Auto-zoom only applies on clip addition

## Files Modified

### `/app/static/js/modules/sequencer.js`
- Added `autoZoomToFitLongestTrack()` method (lines ~853-895)
- Modified `addClipToTrack()` to call auto-zoom after timeline expansion

## Testing Recommendations

1. Add clips of varying lengths (30s, 2min, 5min)
2. Verify zoom adjusts to show entire clip
3. Test with effects panel visible and hidden
4. Check zoom slider updates correctly
5. Verify 10% minimum zoom prevents over-shrinking
6. Confirm manual zoom still works after auto-zoom

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements:
- Add user preference to enable/disable auto-zoom
- Animate the zoom transition for smoother visual feedback
- Add "zoom to fit all" button for manual triggering
- Consider vertical auto-zoom for many tracks
