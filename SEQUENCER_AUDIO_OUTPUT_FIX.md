# Sequencer Audio Output Fix

## Issue
**Symptom:** Uploaded tracks to sequencer and pressed play, but no audio was heard.

**Console Logs:**
```
✅ Sequencer audio routing initialized
✅ Created gain node for track: Track 1
✅ Added uploaded file to sequencer: track.wav (0:06)
🎛️ Updated volume for clip placed-clip-xxx: 1.xx
```

Everything appeared to work, but no sound output.

## Root Causes

### Issue #1: AudioContext Not Initialized
The sequencer was created early with a temporary AudioContext, but when playing standalone (without loading DJ mixer tracks first), the main AudioContext and `merger` node were never created.

**Flow:**
```
User uploads file to sequencer
  ↓
User presses play
  ↓
Sequencer plays clips
  ↓
Audio routes to sequencer.routingGain
  ↓
❌ routingGain not connected to anything!
  ↓
No sound output
```

###Issue #2: Track Gain Nodes Not Reconnected
When the sequencer's AudioContext was updated from temporary to main, the track gain nodes were not recreated or reconnected to the new output gain.

## Solutions Implemented

### Solution #1: Initialize Audio Context on Play

**File:** `app/static/js/modules/sequencer.js`  
**Method:** `play()`

Added event dispatch to trigger main audio context initialization:

```javascript
play() {
    if (this.isPlaying) return;
    
    // NEW: Dispatch event to ensure main audio context is initialized
    document.dispatchEvent(new CustomEvent('sequencerPlayRequested'));
    
    this.isPlaying = true;
    // ... rest of play logic
}
```

### Solution #2: Handle Sequencer Play Event

**File:** `app/static/js/visualizer-dual.js`  
**Location:** Bottom of file (before final console.log)

Added event listener to initialize audio system:

```javascript
document.addEventListener('sequencerPlayRequested', () => {
    // Initialize main audio context if not already done
    if (!audioContext) {
        initAudioContext();
        console.log('✅ Audio context initialized from sequencer play request');
    }
    
    // Ensure sequencer is routed to master if enabled
    if (sequencer && merger && routeSequencer && routeSequencer.checked) {
        const sequencerGain = sequencer.getRoutingGain();
        if (sequencerGain) {
            try {
                sequencerGain.disconnect();
            } catch (e) {
                // Not connected yet
            }
            sequencerGain.connect(merger);
            console.log('✅ Sequencer routed to master from play request');
        }
    }
});
```

### Solution #3: Reconnect Tracks on Audio Context Update

**File:** `app/static/js/modules/sequencer.js`  
**Method:** `initializeAudioRouting()`

Enhanced to handle re-initialization and reconnect existing tracks:

```javascript
initializeAudioRouting() {
    if (!this.audioContext) return;
    
    // Disconnect old nodes if they exist
    if (this.routingGain) {
        try {
            this.routingGain.disconnect();
        } catch (e) {}
    }
    if (this.outputGain) {
        try {
            this.outputGain.disconnect();
        } catch (e) {}
    }
    
    // Create new nodes
    this.outputGain = this.audioContext.createGain();
    this.outputGain.gain.value = 1.0;
    
    this.routingGain = this.audioContext.createGain();
    this.routingGain.gain.value = 1.0;
    
    this.outputGain.connect(this.routingGain);
    
    // NEW: Reconnect all existing tracks to the new outputGain
    this.sequencerTracks.forEach(track => {
        if (track.gainNode) {
            try {
                track.gainNode.disconnect();
            } catch (e) {}
            
            // Recreate track gain node with new audio context
            const volume = track.volume || 0.8;
            track.gainNode = this.audioContext.createGain();
            track.gainNode.gain.value = volume;
            track.gainNode.connect(this.outputGain);
            console.log(`✅ Reconnected track: ${track.name} to new audio context`);
        }
    });
    
    console.log('✅ Sequencer audio routing initialized');
}
```

## Complete Audio Flow (After Fix)

### Standalone Sequencer Usage
```
1. User uploads file to sequencer
   ↓
2. User presses play
   ↓
3. sequencerPlayRequested event dispatched
   ↓
4. Main AudioContext initialized
   ↓
5. Merger node created
   ↓
6. Sequencer routing gain connected to merger
   ↓
7. Clips play through: Clip → Track Gain → Sequencer Output → Sequencer Routing → Merger → Master Effects → Speakers
   ↓
8. ✅ Audio heard!
```

### With DJ Mixer Loaded
```
1. User loads track to DJ mixer
   ↓
2. AudioContext already initialized
   ↓
3. Sequencer routing already connected
   ↓
4. User uploads file to sequencer and plays
   ↓
5. ✅ Audio works immediately
```

## Audio Signal Path

### Full Chain
```
Sequencer Clip
  ↓
Clip Effects (filter, delay, reverb, ADSR)
  ↓
Track Gain Node (per-track volume control)
  ↓
Sequencer Output Gain
  ↓
Sequencer Routing Gain
  ↓
Merger (mixes with DJ tracks, mic, sampler, theremin)
  ↓
Master Filter
  ↓
Master Panner
  ↓
Master Reverb
  ↓
Master Delay
  ↓
Master Gain (volume)
  ↓
Analyser (visualization)
  ↓
Speakers
```

## Console Output

### Before Fix
```
✅ Sequencer initialized early with temporary audio context
✅ Sequencer audio routing initialized
✅ Created gain node for track: Track 1
✅ Added uploaded file to sequencer: track.wav (0:06)
(plays clip - no sound)
```

### After Fix
```
✅ Sequencer initialized early with temporary audio context
✅ Sequencer audio routing initialized
✅ Created gain node for track: Track 1
✅ Added uploaded file to sequencer: track.wav (0:06)
✅ Audio context initialized from sequencer play request
✅ Reconnected track: Track 1 to new audio context
✅ Sequencer routed to master from play request
(plays clip - SOUND WORKS! 🎵)
```

## Key Improvements

### 1. Lazy Audio Initialization
- AudioContext created on-demand when sequencer plays
- Complies with browser autoplay policies
- User interaction (clicking play) allows audio

### 2. Automatic Routing
- Sequencer automatically connects to master output
- No manual routing toggle required initially
- Respects routing checkbox state

### 3. Context Migration
- Seamlessly transitions from temporary to main AudioContext
- All track gain nodes properly reconnected
- No audio glitches or interruptions

### 4. Standalone Operation
- Sequencer works independently of DJ mixer
- No need to load DJ tracks first
- Full mixing capabilities available

## Testing Checklist

- [x] Upload file to sequencer without loading DJ tracks
- [x] Press play → Audio plays correctly
- [x] Volume sliders work (track + master)
- [x] Mute/solo buttons work
- [x] Clip effects work (filter, delay, etc.)
- [x] Load DJ track after sequencer → Both play together
- [x] Routing toggle works to enable/disable sequencer
- [x] Multiple tracks mix correctly
- [x] Recording captures sequencer output

## Browser Compatibility

Works with all modern browsers supporting:
- Web Audio API
- Custom Events
- AudioContext
- GainNode

Tested on:
- ✅ Chrome/Edge (Chromium)
- ✅ Firefox
- ✅ Safari

## Migration Notes

### For Users
- No breaking changes
- Existing workflows preserved
- New: Can use sequencer standalone
- New: Audio automatically initializes on play

### For Developers
- `sequencerPlayRequested` custom event added
- `initializeAudioRouting()` now handles re-initialization
- Track gain nodes recreated when context changes
- Event-driven architecture for audio routing
