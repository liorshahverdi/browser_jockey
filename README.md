**Latest Update (v3.27.8)**: Audio element volume restoration after buffer playback! Fixed critical bug where audio would play silently after using timestretched loop or reverse mode. The audio element volume is now properly restored when switching back to normal playback. See [current-release/RELEASE_NOTES_v3.27.8.md](current-release/RELEASE_NOTES_v3.27.8.md).

```bash
curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh
```

## Quick Start with Docker

### 1. Build and run with Docker Compose:

```bash
docker-compose up --build
```

### 2. Access the application:

Open your browser and navigate to: `http://localhost:5001`

### 3. Stop the application:

```bash
docker-compose down
```

## Alternative: Build with Docker only

### Build the image:

```bash
docker build -t audio-visualizer .
```

### Run the container:

```bash
docker run -p 5001:5001 audio-visualizer
```

## Local Development (Without Docker)

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd browser_jockey
```

### 2. Create a Virtual Environment with uv

```bash
uv venv
source .venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate
```

### 3. Install Dependencies with uv

```bash
uv pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 4. Run the Application

```bash
python run.py
```

### 5. Access the Application

Open your browser and navigate to: `http://localhost:5001`

## Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file based on `.env.example`:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

Available environment variables:

- `FLASK_ENV` - Environment mode (development/production)
- `FLASK_DEBUG` - Enable/disable debug mode (0/1)
- `SECRET_KEY` - Secret key for Flask sessions
- `HOST` - Host address (default: 0.0.0.0)
- `PORT` - Port number (default: 5001)

## Production Deployment

### Deploy to Render (Recommended):

1. **Fork or push this repository to GitHub**

2. **Create a new Web Service on Render:**
   - Go to [render.com](https://render.com) and sign in
   - Click "New +" and select "Web Service"
   - Connect your GitHub repository
   - Render will automatically detect the `render.yaml` file

3. **Alternatively, manual setup:**
   - Runtime: Docker
   - Build Command: (leave empty, uses Dockerfile)
   - Start Command: (leave empty, uses Dockerfile CMD)
   - Set environment variables:
     - `FLASK_ENV=production`
     - `FLASK_DEBUG=0`
     - `SECRET_KEY` (generate a strong secret key)
     - `HOST=0.0.0.0`
     - `PORT=5001`

4. **Deploy!**
   - Render will build and deploy your application
   - Access your app at the provided URL (e.g., `https://browser-jockey.onrender.com`)

**Note**: The free tier on Render may spin down after inactivity and take ~30 seconds to restart.

### Using Docker:

1. Update `.env` file for production:
```bash
FLASK_ENV=production
FLASK_DEBUG=0
SECRET_KEY=generate-a-strong-secret-key
```

2. Comment out volume mounts in `docker-compose.yml`

3. Run with Docker Compose:
```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

### Using Gunicorn (Production WSGI Server):

```bash
# With uv
uv pip install gunicorn
gunicorn -w 4 -b 0.0.0.0:5001 run:app
```

## Musical Key Detection

The app analyzes each track's audio buffer to detect the musical key, and uses real-time frequency analysis for visualization colors:

**Key → Color Mapping**:
- **C** → Red
- **C#** → Orange
- **D** → Yellow
- **D#** → Lime
- **E** → Green
- **F** → Cyan
- **F#** → Teal
- **G** → Blue
- **G#** → Indigo
- **A** → Purple
- **A#** → Magenta
- **B** → Pink

Each key has its own color, creating a unique visual experience for different songs!
