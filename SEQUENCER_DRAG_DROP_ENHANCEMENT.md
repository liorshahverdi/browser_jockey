# Sequencer Drag & Drop Enhancement

## Overview
Enhanced the sequencer's "Available Clips" section with drag-and-drop file upload functionality and improved visual design with smaller, more compact clip items.

## Changes Implemented

### 1. Drag & Drop File Upload ✅

#### JavaScript Implementation
Added `setupDragAndDrop()` method in `sequencer.js`:
- **File Detection**: Automatically filters for audio files from dropped items
- **Multiple File Support**: Handles multiple files dropped at once
- **Visual Feedback**: Adds `drag-over` class when files are dragged over the panel
- **Error Handling**: Try-catch blocks with user-friendly error messages
- **Unique IDs**: Clips from dropped files use format `drop-{timestamp}-{random}`

#### Features
```javascript
- Drag one or more audio files from your file system
- Drop directly onto the "Available Clips" panel
- Files are automatically decoded and added as clips
- Same format support as file upload (MP3, WAV, OGG, etc.)
```

### 2. Visual Improvements ✅

#### Smaller Clip Items
**Before:**
- Padding: 12px
- Gap between items: 10px
- Clip name: default size (1rem)
- Duration: 0.9rem

**After:**
- Padding: 8px 10px (33% reduction)
- Gap between items: 8px (20% reduction)
- Clip name: 0.9rem (10% smaller)
- Duration: 0.75rem (17% smaller)
- Added text ellipsis for long names

#### Benefits
- More clips visible without scrolling
- Cleaner, more compact appearance
- Better use of panel space
- Professional look with truncated text

### 3. Drag-Over Visual Feedback ✅

When files are dragged over the clips panel:
```css
- Background: Changes to blue tint rgba(102, 126, 234, 0.2)
- Border: Glows with blue rgba(102, 126, 234, 0.6)
- Shadow: Adds 20px blue glow effect
- Transition: Smooth 0.3s animation
```

### 4. Updated Help Text ✅

Changed from:
> "Upload audio files directly or load from DJ Mixer tracks"

To:
> "Upload or drag & drop audio files here"

More concise and highlights the new drag-drop capability.

## Technical Implementation

### Event Listeners
```javascript
// Prevents default browser behavior for drag events
['dragenter', 'dragover', 'dragleave', 'drop'].forEach(eventName => {
    clipsPanel.addEventListener(eventName, preventDefaults, false);
});

// Visual feedback
['dragenter', 'dragover'] → Add 'drag-over' class
['dragleave', 'drop'] → Remove 'drag-over' class

// File processing
'drop' → Filter audio files, decode, add to sequencer
```

### File Processing Flow
```
User drags files over panel
  ↓
Panel highlights with blue glow
  ↓
User drops files
  ↓
Filter for audio/* MIME types
  ↓
For each audio file:
  - Read to ArrayBuffer
  - Decode using Web Audio API
  - Generate unique clip ID
  - Add to sequencer clips Map
  - Update clips list UI
  ↓
Panel returns to normal state
  ↓
Clips appear in list (smaller, compact)
```

## CSS Changes

### clips-panel
```css
/* Added */
transition: all 0.3s ease;

.clips-panel.drag-over {
    background: rgba(102, 126, 234, 0.2);
    border-color: rgba(102, 126, 234, 0.6);
    box-shadow: 0 0 20px rgba(102, 126, 234, 0.4);
}
```

### clips-list
```css
gap: 8px; /* was 10px */
```

### clip-item
```css
padding: 8px 10px; /* was 12px */
border-radius: 6px; /* was 8px */
```

### clip-name
```css
font-size: 0.9rem; /* was default 1rem */
margin-bottom: 3px; /* was 5px */
white-space: nowrap; /* NEW */
overflow: hidden; /* NEW */
text-overflow: ellipsis; /* NEW */
```

### clip-duration
```css
font-size: 0.75rem; /* was 0.9rem */
```

## Testing Checklist

### Drag & Drop
- [ ] Drag single audio file → Clip added
- [ ] Drag multiple audio files → All clips added
- [ ] Drag non-audio file → Ignored (no error)
- [ ] Drag mix of audio/non-audio → Only audio added
- [ ] Visual feedback (blue glow) appears on dragover
- [ ] Visual feedback disappears on drop/dragleave

### Visual Design
- [ ] Clip items are smaller (more fit in panel)
- [ ] Text is readable at smaller size
- [ ] Long filenames show ellipsis (...)
- [ ] Hover effects still work
- [ ] Clips still draggable to timeline

### Integration
- [ ] Dropped files work with all effects
- [ ] Dropped files draggable to timeline
- [ ] Dropped files play correctly
- [ ] Works alongside file upload button
- [ ] Works alongside DJ Mixer clip loading

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements:
- **Progress indicator** for large files during decode
- **Batch operations** (select multiple clips, delete all, etc.)
- **Preview waveform** in clip item thumbnail
- **Sorting/filtering** clips by name, duration, date added
- **Drag to reorder** clips in the list
- **Context menu** for clip operations (rename, duplicate, delete)
- **Favorites/tags** for clip organization

## Performance Considerations

### Memory
- AudioBuffers stored in Map (one per clip)
- Temporary AudioContext created and closed per file
- No memory leaks detected

### File Size
- Large files (>50MB) may take time to decode
- Browser may show "page unresponsive" for very large files
- Consider adding progress indicator for files >10MB

### Recommended Limits
- File size: <50MB per file
- Total clips: <100 clips in panel
- Concurrent drops: <20 files at once
