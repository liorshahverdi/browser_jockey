# Sequencer Quick Start Guide

## What is it?

The Sequencer is a new feature in Browser Jockey that lets you arrange audio clips on a timeline, like a simplified DAW (Digital Audio Workstation). You can layer multiple tracks, position clips at different times, and create complex arrangements.

## Quick Start (5 Steps)

### 1. Load Some Audio 🎵
- Go to the **DJ Mixer** tab
- Click "📁 Choose Audio" on Track 1
- Select an audio file from your computer
- Repeat for Track 2 if desired

### 2. Open the Sequencer 🎼
- Click the **🎼 Sequencer** tab at the top
- You'll see your loaded tracks in the "Available Clips" panel on the left

### 3. Create a Track 🎚️
- The sequencer starts with one track (Track 1)
- Click **➕ Add New Track** in the clips panel to add more

### 4. Add Clips to Timeline 🎯
- **Drag** a clip from the left panel
- **Drop** it onto any track in the timeline
- The clip will snap to the nearest bar
- Repeat to build your arrangement

### 5. Play Your Arrangement ▶️
- Click the **▶️ Play** button
- Watch the red playhead move across your timeline
- Adjust clips as needed and replay

## Key Controls

| Button | Function |
|--------|----------|
| ▶️ Play | Start playback from beginning |
| ⏸️ Pause | Pause playback |
| ⏹️ Stop | Stop and reset to start |
| ➕ Add Bar | Make timeline longer |
| ➖ Remove Bar | Make timeline shorter |
| 🔇 Mute | Silence a track |
| 🎯 Solo | Play only this track |
| 🗑️ Delete | Remove a track |

## Tips & Tricks

### Moving Clips
- **Click and drag** a clip to reposition it on the same track
- Clips **snap to bars** automatically for easy alignment

### Deleting Clips
- **Double-click** a clip to remove it from the timeline

### Track Management
- Use **Mute** to test arrangements without deleting clips
- Use **Solo** to focus on one track at a time
- Create multiple tracks to layer different elements

### BPM Settings
- Set BPM to match your audio files
- Higher BPM = faster playback, shorter bars
- Lower BPM = slower playback, longer bars

### Timeline Length
- Start with 4-8 bars
- Add more bars as your arrangement grows
- Each bar is one measure (4 beats in 4/4 time)

## Common Workflows

### Simple Loop
1. Load one track
2. Drag clip to bar 1
3. Set to 4 bars
4. Click play

### Layered Arrangement
1. Load two different tracks
2. Create 2-3 sequencer tracks
3. Drag clips to different positions
4. Layer clips on different tracks
5. Use mute/solo to test combinations

### Build-up Effect
1. Load a track
2. Create multiple tracks
3. Add clip at bar 1 on Track 1
4. Add same clip at bar 3 on Track 2
5. Add same clip at bar 5 on Track 3
6. Creates a layering effect over time

## Keyboard Tips

Currently no keyboard shortcuts, but you can:
- **Tab** to switch between buttons
- **Enter** to activate focused button
- **Spacebar** might trigger play/pause (browser dependent)

## Troubleshooting

**Q: I don't see any clips in the Available Clips panel**
A: Load audio files in the DJ Mixer tab first

**Q: Clips won't drag**
A: Make sure you click and hold on the clip, then drag

**Q: How do I save my arrangement?**
A: Currently, switch to DJ Mixer tab and use Master Recording to capture the output

**Q: Can I edit clip length?**
A: Not yet - clips use the full audio file duration

**Q: Play button doesn't work**
A: Make sure you've placed at least one clip on the timeline

## Next Steps

Once you're comfortable with the basics:
- Experiment with different clip positions
- Try layering multiple instances of the same clip
- Use mute/solo to create variations
- Adjust BPM to match different tempos
- Create longer arrangements with more bars
