# Crossfader Feature

## Overview
Added professional DJ crossfader to the mixer section, enabling smooth transitions between audio sources using equal-power crossfade curves.

## Implementation Date
October 24, 2025 (v3.10.0)

## Features

### 1. Three-Column Layout
- Restructured main interface to authentic DJ layout
- Track 1 (left) | DJ Mixer (center) | Track 2 (right)
- Full browser width utilization with 2fr-1fr-2fr grid proportions

### 2. Crossfader Control
- **Professional slider** with gradient visualization (cyan to purple)
- **Equal-power crossfade curve** using cosine/sine functions for constant perceived loudness
- **Real-time gain adjustment** maintaining volume slider settings
- **Visual feedback** showing percentage split between sources

### 3. Multiple Crossfade Modes
Users can select from three crossfading modes:

#### Track 1 ↔ Track 2 (Default)
- Crossfade between the two main tracks
- Position 0 (left): 100% Track 1, 0% Track 2
- Position 50 (center): Equal mix of both tracks
- Position 100 (right): 0% Track 1, 100% Track 2

#### Track 1 ↔ Microphone
- Crossfade between Track 1 and live microphone input
- Allows DJs to transition between music and live vocals/instruments
- Track 2 plays at normal volume (unaffected)

#### Track 2 ↔ Microphone
- Crossfade between Track 2 and live microphone input
- Alternative mic routing for different performance styles
- Track 1 plays at normal volume (unaffected)

### 4. Dynamic Labels
- Labels automatically update based on selected mode
- Left/Right labels show which sources are being crossfaded
- Center label always shows "CENTER" for reference

## Technical Implementation

### Equal-Power Crossfade Algorithm
```javascript
const leftGain = Math.cos((value / 100) * (Math.PI / 2));
const rightGain = Math.sin((value / 100) * (Math.PI / 2));
```

This uses cosine for the fading-out source and sine for the fading-in source, ensuring:
- Constant total power (leftGain² + rightGain² = 1)
- Smooth transition without volume dips in the middle
- Professional DJ mixer standard

### Volume Slider Integration
- Volume sliders now call `updateCrossfader()` to maintain crossfade position
- Prevents volume slider from overriding crossfader settings
- Crossfader applies as a multiplier to volume slider values

### Audio Node Routing
- Uses existing `gain1`, `gain2`, and `micGainNode` nodes
- Dynamically adjusts gain values based on crossfader position
- Respects master routing toggles for complete control

## Bug Fix (v3.10.0)
Fixed critical crossfader bug where incorrect variable names (`gainNode1`/`gainNode2`) were used instead of the actual gain nodes (`gain1`/`gain2`), causing the crossfader to have no effect.

## UI/UX Design

### Styling
- Purple to cyan gradient matching app theme
- Smooth hover effects and transitions
- Clear visual indication of crossfader position
- Responsive layout adapting to browser width

### Layout Changes
- Master effects section reorganized (volume/pan left, effects right)
- Compact two-column grid in master controls
- DJ mixer positioned centrally between decks

## User Experience Benefits

1. **Professional Workflow**: Authentic DJ mixer layout familiar to DJs
2. **Smooth Transitions**: Equal-power curves prevent volume dips
3. **Flexible Routing**: Multiple mode options for creative mixing
4. **Visual Feedback**: Clear indication of mix balance
5. **Live Performance**: Quick transitions between tracks or mic input

## Files Modified

- `app/templates/index.html` - Added crossfader HTML structure and reorganized layout
- `app/static/css/style.css` - Added crossfader styling and layout adjustments
- `app/static/js/visualizer-dual.js` - Implemented crossfader logic and event handlers

## Related Features

- Works seamlessly with existing dual track controls
- Integrates with microphone input system
- Respects master routing toggles
- Compatible with all audio effects
- Maintains tempo and volume slider settings

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements for future versions:
- Crossfader curve selection (linear, logarithmic, equal-power)
- Reverse crossfader mode (swap left/right behavior)
- MIDI controller support for hardware crossfader
- Crossfader assignment to effect parameters
- Custom crossfade curves for different genres
